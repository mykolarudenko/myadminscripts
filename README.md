# Admin Scripts

A collection of my personal administrative scripts.

I keep them here on GitHub so I can quickly pull them onto a new system when needed.

You are welcome to use these scripts for any purpose under the terms of the MIT License.  
**Use at your own risk.**  
No warranties of any kind are provided.

These scripts were not designed for public use or distribution. I originally wrote them for myself only.
